# Multilingual Hate Speech Detection Using Deep Learning Methods

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting hate speech in multiple languages using deep learning methods. It collects data from YouTube, processes it, and employs various machine learning models to classify the text. The project uses the Tf-IDF vectorizer for feature engineering and evaluates multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and H2O Deep Learning models, to achieve high accuracy in classification.

## Features

- Multilingual data collection and processing
- Text feature extraction using Tf-IDF
- Model training with Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and H2O Deep Learning
- Performance evaluation with accuracy and F1 score metrics

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the project.
- `README.md`: This file with project details.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arvindselvamoorthy15/Multilingual-Hate-Speech-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-Methods.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Multilingual-Hate-Speech-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-Methods
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

- **Scripts**: Run individual scripts from the command line or within a Jupyter Notebook.
- **Notebooks**: Open and run the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data interactively.
